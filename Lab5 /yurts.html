    <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is
        fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be
        opened.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
        Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
        running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
        changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
        bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!<br><br>
